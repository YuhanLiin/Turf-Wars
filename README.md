# Turf-Wars
This is a game I made for my final project in Computer Science class. It is a two player "shooting" game set in an overhead view with the objective of one player defeating the other. The project is written in Java using the AWT applets interface. The code is structured in a homebrewn MVC architecture I devised on my own. The MainApplet class is the applet class from which the game is run and also contains a main() method, which allows the game to be compiled as an offline Java executable as well as a browser-run applet.
