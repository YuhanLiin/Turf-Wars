# Turf-Wars
This is a game I made for my final project in Computer Science class. It is a two player "shooting" game set in an overhead view with the objective of one player defeating the other. The project is written in Java using the AWT applets interface. The code is structured in a homebrewn MVC architecture I devised for practice.
